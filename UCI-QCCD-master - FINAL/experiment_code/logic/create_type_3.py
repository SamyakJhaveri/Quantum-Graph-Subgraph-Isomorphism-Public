"""
ast.NodeTransformer is a subclass of ast.NodeVisitor that walks through an ast tree 
and can apply transformations to any node in the tree.

NodeTransformer allows you to override the visit methods, and modifying the 
methodâ€™s return value allows you to transform the node as the programmer wishes. 
If the return value is set to None, then that node is removed from the tree. 
If no replacement is done to the return value, the return value will be the original node.
